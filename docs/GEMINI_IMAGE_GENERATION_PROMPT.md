## Project Context

We're building a fitness/training application called **Konditionstest** - a professional platform for coaches and athletes focusing on endurance training, strength training, and physiological testing. The app includes:

- **181 exercises** organized by biomechanical function
- **Focus Mode** - full-screen mobile workout execution where athletes see one exercise at a time
- **Coach Exercise Library** - browse and manage exercises with thumbnails
- **Multi-language support** - Swedish primary, English secondary

We need AI-generated images for each exercise to display during workouts. These images will be the primary visual guide for athletes performing exercises.
