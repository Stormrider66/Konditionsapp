# Standardization of Field Testing Protocols for Ergometer-Based Conditioning in Intermittent Sports and Functional Fitness

## Executive Summary

The integration of ergometer-based conditioning—specifically utilizing the Assault/Air Bike, Concept2 RowErg, Concept2 SkiErg, and Wattbike—has become ubiquitous in the physical preparation of athletes involved in intermittent team sports (Ice Hockey, Football/Soccer, Handball) and hybrid functional fitness (HYROX, CrossFit). These modalities offer a distinct advantage: the ability to impose high-magnitude central cardiovascular and peripheral metabolic strain while minimizing the eccentric mechanical loading and collision trauma inherent to the athletes' primary sports. However, the efficacy of "off-feet" conditioning is fundamentally contingent upon the validity, reliability, and specificity of the testing protocols used to prescribe training intensities.

A significant disconnect currently exists between the testing modalities derived from endurance sports (e.g., the 20-minute functional threshold power test for cyclists) and the physiological realities of anaerobic-dominant team sport athletes. This report provides a comprehensive, evidence-based analysis of standardized field testing protocols for these four primary ergometers. It synthesizes peer-reviewed literature and applied high-performance data to establish robust testing batteries, normative values, and zone prescription methodologies. Central to this analysis is the application of the Critical Power (CP) model across modalities, the biomechanical distinctions of power production (e.g., belt-drive vs. chain-drive mechanics), and the translation of ergometer power to sport-specific bioenergetics.

Furthermore, this report addresses the critical need for "translation" between modalities. An athlete's maximal aerobic power (MAP) on a running track does not equate to their MAP on a Wattbike or SkiErg due to variances in active muscle mass, mechanical efficiency, and local limiting factors. By establishing determining factors for each machine—Critical Power (CP), W' (anaerobic work capacity), and Peak Power—practitioners can calculate precise training zones that respect the unique physiological demands of Ice Hockey, Football, Handball, and Functional Fitness.

## 1. Assault Bike and Air Bike Testing Protocols

The "Air Bike" (or fan resistance bike) represents a unique category of ergometer where resistance is generated by air displacement, scaling exponentially with rotational velocity. Unlike fixed-resistance ergometers, the air bike requires the athlete to overcome aerodynamic drag that increases with the cube of the speed. This distinct resistance curve, combined with the quadrupedal nature of the movement (simultaneous push/pull of arms and pedaling of legs), results in a metabolic demand that differs significantly from traditional cycling.

### 1.1 Biomechanical and Mechanical Variance: Brand Comparisons

A critical failure in many conditioning programs is the interchangeable treatment of different air bike brands. Mechanical differences between the primary market leaders—Assault Fitness, Rogue Fitness (Echo), and Schwinn (Airdyne)—result in distinct power-output profiles that render data non-comparable without correction factors.

#### 1.1.1 Assault AirBike (Chain Drive)

The Assault AirBike utilizes a chain drive system connected to a relatively light fan. This mechanical setup allows for significant "run-on" or flywheel momentum. When an athlete performs a maximal burst and then ceases active propulsion, the fan continues to spin for a measurable duration, accumulating distance and calories during the passive phase. This "ghost riding" phenomenon inflates calorie counts, particularly in interval formats with frequent starts and stops or short, high-intensity bursts. The chain drive also introduces a tactile feedback loop where the tension is not immediate; there is a fraction of a second of "slack" before the force is applied to the fan, which can affect peak power readings in millisecond-sensitive tests.

#### 1.1.2 Rogue Echo Bike (Belt Drive)

The Rogue Echo Bike utilizes a belt drive system connected to a heavier, larger fan with metal blades. The belt drive eliminates the slack found in chain systems, providing immediate tension. More importantly, the belt drive and heavy fan mass create a system with high inertia but rapid deceleration. When the athlete stops applying force, the fan slows down almost immediately. There is virtually no "ghost riding". Consequently, for the same perceived exertion and RPM, calorie accumulation is slower and subjectively "harder" on the Echo Bike because the athlete must constantly apply force to maintain momentum.

#### Comparative Data and Conversion

Research and extensive field observations indicate a significant discrepancy in caloric output between the two machines. The Rogue Echo Bike typically yields calorie and distance scores that are approximately 15% to 20% lower than the Assault AirBike for the same duration and relative intensity.

**Conversion Formula:**

$$\text{Echo Calories} \approx \text{Assault Calories} \times 0.80$$

**Implication:** A standard benchmark of 50 calories on an Assault Bike should be scaled to approximately 40-42 calories on an Echo Bike to elicit a similar physiological stimulus and time domain.

### 1.2 Power Calculation: The Physics of Air Resistance

Understanding the physics of the machine is vital for accurate zone prescription. On all fan bikes, power (P) is a cubic function of cadence or angular velocity (RPM).

$$P \propto RPM^3$$

This relationship implies that resistance scales exponentially. A small increase in RPM requires a massive increase in power output. For example, increasing cadence from 60 RPM to 66 RPM (a 10% increase) requires approximately 33% more power (1.10³ ≈ 1.33). This makes "negative splitting" (speeding up at the end of an interval) metabolically devastating compared to linear resistance modalities.

#### The Calorie-Watt Relationship

While power (Watts) is a direct measure of mechanical work, "Calories" on these machines are a derived unit of energy, calculated via an algorithm that often includes a base metabolic rate factor.

**Formula approximation:**

$$\text{Calories/min} \approx (\text{Watts} \times \text{Constant}) + \text{Base Rate}$$

**Trend:** The relationship between Watts and Calories is essentially linear over time, but the accumulation of calories accelerates with RPM. At 100 Watts, an athlete might burn ~5 cal/min. At 500 Watts, they might burn ~35 cal/min.

### 1.3 Standardized Field Test Protocols

Given the anaerobic dominance and whole-body recruitment of air bike usage, testing protocols should focus on identifying peak neuromuscular power, glycolytic capacity, and aerobic power.

#### 1.3.1 The Maximum Aerobic Power (MAP) Ramp Test

This protocol is designed to identify the upper limit of aerobic energy production and allow for the calculation of submaximal training zones.

**Protocol:** The athlete begins at a low, fixed wattage (e.g., 100 Watts for men, 50 Watts for women) or RPM. Every minute, the target intensity increases by a set increment (e.g., +25-50 Watts per minute). The test terminates when the athlete can no longer maintain the target RPM/Wattage for the full minute.

**Metric:** The highest average wattage sustained for a full minute is the MAP.

**Validity:** This test is highly valid for prescribing aerobic intervals (e.g., Zone 2 rides at 55-65% MAP) but may underestimate anaerobic capacity for power athletes.

#### 1.3.2 The 10-Minute Max Calories Test

This maximal effort test is widely used in the functional fitness community as a proxy for Lactate Threshold or Critical Power. Ten minutes is a "sweet spot" duration: it is long enough to exhaust anaerobic reserves (W') significantly, forcing reliance on oxidative metabolism, yet short enough to be psychologically manageable for power athletes.

**Protocol:** 10 minutes all-out for maximum calories.

**Normative Data (Functional Fitness/CrossFit):**

| Level | Men | Women |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Elite | > 1.1-1.2 cal/lb body weight (~200+ cal) | > 1.0 cal/lb body weight (~150+ cal) |
| Advanced | 1.0 cal/lb body weight | 0.8-0.9 cal/lb body weight |
| Intermediate | 0.8 cal/lb body weight | — |

**Training Application:** The average RPM from this test represents the athlete's "Threshold Pace."

#### 1.3.3 Anaerobic Power Tests (Peak Power and 30s Sprint)

**Max Watts (Instantaneous):** This measures peak neuromuscular power and limb velocity.

**Protocol:** A rolling start is used to overcome the initial inertia of the fan. The athlete builds moderate speed for 30 seconds, then sprints maximally for 10-20 seconds.

**Measurement:** The console displays "Max Watts," which is typically an average of the highest sampling interval (often 1 second). This value is not instantaneous peak torque but the highest sustained burst.

**Normative Values:**

| Population | Men | Women |
|------------|-----|-------|
| Elite power athletes | > 1500W | > 1000W |
| Team sport athletes | 1000-1300W | 700-900W |

**30-Second Max Calories (Wingate Proxy):** A test of glycolytic power and buffering capacity.

**Norms:** 50+ calories (Men) and 35+ calories (Women) are considered elite benchmarks.

### 1.4 Reliability and Validity vs. Gold Standard

Studies comparing Air Bikes to cycle ergometers and treadmills for VO2max testing demonstrate good to excellent reliability (ICC > 0.89) but reveal systematic bias in absolute values.

- **Higher than Cycling:** Air Bike protocols typically elicit higher VO2max values (~3-5 ml/kg/min) compared to leg-only cycling. This is attributed to the larger volume of active muscle mass (arms + legs) demanding more oxygen.

- **Lower than Running:** For non-specific athletes, Air Bike VO2max is often lower than treadmill running. This is likely due to peripheral fatigue (muscular failure in the quadriceps or triceps) occurring before the central cardiovascular system reaches its absolute limit.

**Practical Recommendation:** Air Bike test results should be used specifically to prescribe Air Bike training. Transferring heart rate zones or power targets from an air bike test to running or rowing will likely result in inaccurate prescription due to these physiological discrepancies.

## 2. Concept2 SkiErg vs. Rowing Ergometer

Concept2 ergometers (RowErg and SkiErg) are the "gold standard" in conditioning due to the self-calibrating Performance Monitor (PM5), which ensures data consistency across machines and environments. However, despite sharing the same flywheel and monitor technology, the biomechanics of the movements necessitate distinct testing and prescription protocols.

### 2.1 Drag Factor: The Great Equalizer

A common error in field testing is relying on the damper setting (1-10 lever) rather than the Drag Factor. The damper lever controls the aperture of the flywheel cage, but the actual resistance is determined by how much air enters and decelerates the flywheel. This is influenced by dust accumulation, humidity, and altitude. A damper setting of 5 on a dusty gym machine might equate to a damper of 3 on a brand-new machine.

**Mechanism:** The PM5 calculates drag factor on every rundown of the flywheel (between strokes). This value allows the monitor to calculate true work (power) regardless of the damper setting.

**Standardization Recommendations:**

| Ergometer | Standard Drag Factor | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| RowErg | 110-130 (men), 100-120 (women) | Roughly damper 3-5; heavyweights often test at 130 |
| SkiErg | 80-100 | Lower drag facilitates higher stroke rate turnover |

**Implication:** Testing at a drag factor significantly different from training will invalidate zone prescriptions. A test performed at max drag (200) will result in early muscular failure rather than cardiovascular peak.

### 2.2 Power Output Ratio: SkiErg vs. RowErg

Human biomechanics dictate that power production on the SkiErg is lower than on the RowErg for the same systemic stress.

**Muscle Recruitment:** Rowing utilizes approximately 85% of the body's muscle mass, driven by the powerful extension of the hips and knees (quadriceps/glutes) followed by the trunk and arms. Skiing is upper-body dominant, relying heavily on the lats, triceps, and abdominals (core flexion), with the legs providing stability and a smaller propulsive component via gravity-assisted drops.

**The Ratio:** Empirical data and athlete profiles suggest that for the same metabolic cost (e.g., Heart Rate or RPE), SkiErg power output (Watts) is approximately 10-15% lower than RowErg power.

**Formula:**

$$\text{Ski Watts} \approx 0.85 \text{ to } 0.90 \times \text{Row Watts}$$

**Pace Implication:** Because of the cubic relationship between watts and pace, a 2:00/500m split (202 Watts) on the rower is roughly equivalent to a 2:05-2:08/500m split on the SkiErg for a balanced athlete.

**Exception:** Athletes with specific backgrounds (e.g., competitive swimmers or cross-country skiers) may demonstrate a ratio closer to 1:1 due to superior upper-body endurance and technique.

### 2.3 Standardized Testing Protocols

#### 2.3.1 The 2000m Time Trial (Row & Ski)

The 2000m test is the standard for aerobic power profiling in rowing. It represents an effort that is approximately 75% aerobic and 25% anaerobic.

**Protocol:** Max effort for 2000 meters.

**Metrics:** Time, Average Pace (/500m), Average Watts, Stroke Rate.

**Zones:** Average watts from the 2k test are used to define training bands:

| Zone | Name | % of 2k Watts |
|------|------|---------------|
| UT2 | Endurance | 55-65% |
| UT1 | Tempo | 70-80% |
| TR | Threshold | 85-95% |
| AN | Anaerobic | >105% |

#### 2.3.2 Concept2 SkiErg 1000m Test

In functional fitness (HYROX/CrossFit), the 1000m distance on the SkiErg has emerged as the primary benchmark, roughly equivalent in time domain to a 500m-750m row or a very long sprint.

**Normative Data (Men):**

| Level | Time | Pace |
|-------|------|------|
| Elite | < 2:55 - 3:00 | Sub 1:30/500m |
| Competitive | 3:15 - 3:30 | — |
| Average | 3:45 - 4:00 | — |

**Normative Data (Women):**

| Level | Time | Pace |
|-------|------|------|
| Elite | < 3:25 - 3:30 | Sub 1:45/500m |
| Competitive | 3:45 - 4:00 | — |
| Average | 4:15 - 4:30 | — |

#### 2.3.3 The Seven-Stroke Max Power Test

This test measures Peak Power (Pmax) and is critical for identifying the athlete's anaerobic reserve.

**Protocol:** From a dead stop, the athlete performs seven maximal strokes. The PM5 records the peak wattage reached (usually on the 3rd or 4th stroke).

**Application:** If an athlete has a high 2k score but a low Peak Power, they are likely efficiency-dominant and need power training. If they have a high Peak Power but poor 2k, they lack aerobic capacity.

---

## 3. Wattbike Testing for Non-Cyclists

The Wattbike is a precision tool capable of measuring power within 2% accuracy and providing detailed pedal stroke analysis (Polar View). For team sport athletes (Rugby, Hockey, Football), it serves as the primary "off-feet" conditioning tool. However, testing protocols derived from professional cycling are often inappropriate for these athletes.

### 3.1 Limitations of the 20-Minute FTP Test for Non-Cyclists

The standard cycling test—20 minutes maximal effort, with FTP calculated as 95% of the average power—assumes that the athlete's limiting factor is systemic aerobic power. For a hockey or rugby player who does not cycle professionally, the limiting factor is often local muscular fatigue (peripheral) or pedaling inefficiency, not cardiovascular capacity.

**Validity of the 0.95 Factor:** For anaerobic-dominant athletes, the standard 0.95 correction factor is problematic. These athletes often have a massive anaerobic capacity (W') that allows them to "muscle through" a 20-minute test at a wattage significantly higher than their true steady-state (CP). Consequently, 95% of this inflated 20-minute power yields an FTP that is too high, leading to training zones that are unsustainable.

**Adjustment:** A correction factor of 0.90 is often safer for anaerobic athletes, or alternatively, the use of the Critical Power model (3-Minute All-Out Test) which mathematically separates the aerobic and anaerobic components.

### 3.2 The 3-Minute All-Out Test (3MT): A Better Alternative?

For non-cyclists, the 3-Minute All-Out Test (3MT) is arguably superior to the 20-minute test.

**Protocol:** The athlete pedals at a maximal effort for 3 minutes. The strategy is "fly and die"—no pacing.

**Outcome:** The average power of the final 30 seconds represents Critical Power (CP). The total work performed above this CP represents the W' (anaerobic work capacity).

**Why for Team Sports?**
- It removes the pacing skill required for a 20-minute test
- It is shorter, fitting better into time-constrained schedules
- It provides two metrics (CP and W') rather than just one (FTP), which is vital for characterizing the intermittent profiles of hockey and handball players

### 3.3 The 6-Second Peak Power Test: Neuromuscular Profiling

For contact sports like Rugby and Ice Hockey, peak neuromuscular power is a critical KPI.

**Protocol:** From a standing or rolling start, the athlete sprints maximally for 6 seconds against high resistance (air setting 10, magnetic setting 1-5 depending on weight).

**Normative Data (Rugby Union):**

| Position | Characteristics |
|----------|-----------------|
| Elite Forwards | High absolute power (>1300-1500 Watts), but lower W/kg due to high body mass |
| Elite Backs | Lower absolute power, but very high relative power (>17-19 W/kg) |

**Correlation:** Wattbike peak power is highly correlated with on-field acceleration (10m and 20m sprint times).

### 3.4 Transferability: Wattbike vs. Running vs. Skating

Wattbike power does not translate 1:1 to running power.

**Mechanical Efficiency:** Running leverages the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) of tendons, achieving mechanical efficiencies of 40-50%. Cycling is concentric-dominant with efficiencies of only 20-25%.

**Power Output:** Elite runners often generate higher metabolic power but lower measured mechanical power on a bike because they lack specific pedaling mechanics. A team sport athlete's cycling VO2max/Power will typically be 5-10% lower than their treadmill scores.

**Skating Transfer:** The Wattbike is the preferred off-ice modality for Ice Hockey because the concentric hip/knee extension angles mimic the skating stride more closely than running, without the eccentric impact shock.

---

## 4. Critical Power (CP) and W' Parameters by Modality

The Critical Power model offers a sophisticated framework for prescribing high-intensity interval training (HIIT) by defining the boundary between sustainable (heavy) and unsustainable (severe) exercise domains.

### 4.1 Typical W' (Anaerobic Work Capacity) Values

W' represents the finite "battery" of energy available for work above Critical Power, measured in Kilojoules (kJ).

| Modality | Typical W' Range | Notes |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| Cycling | 15-25 kJ | Standard for trained cyclists |
| Rowing | 20-35 kJ (40+ kJ elite) | Higher due to larger total muscle mass recruitment |
| Assault Bike | Potentially >35 kJ (elite) | Maximal upper + lower body recruitment |

### 4.2 CP Model Validity (3-min vs. 12-min Protocols)

The CP model can be derived from various protocols.

**3-Minute All-Out Test (3MT):** Validated for both cycling and rowing. The end-power (last 30s) = CP. The work above end-power = W'.
- **Pros:** Single visit efficiency
- **Cons:** Requires extreme motivation; "pacing" the test invalidates the W' calculation

**Multi-Test Linear Model (Work vs. Time):** This involves performing 2-3 separate maximal trials (e.g., 3-minute, 7-minute, and 12-minute TTs) on different days. Total Work (Joules) is plotted against Time (seconds). The slope of the line is CP; the y-intercept is W'.
- **Pros:** Psychologically easier than a single death-effort; statistically more robust if one test is "off"
- **Cons:** Time-consuming

**Modality Adjustments:** The linear model (Work vs. Time) is generally more reliable for rowing and skiing than the 1/time model, as it is less sensitive to errors in the short duration tests.

---

## 5. Sport-Specific Energy System Demands

Understanding the energetic demands of the sport allows for the selection of the correct ergometer test and training protocol.

### 5.1 Ice Hockey

**Profile:** Intermittent high-intensity nature. Shifts last 30-80s, with a work:rest ratio of 1:2 to 1:3.

**Energy Systems:** Heavy reliance on the ATP-PCr system for bursts and the glycolytic system for shift endurance. Aerobic power is critical for recovery between shifts (replenishing W').

**Conditioning Focus:** Repeat Sprint Ability (RSA) and W' Reconstitution.

**Recommended Test:** Wattbike 6-second Peak Power (Neuromuscular) and Assault Bike 30-second Max Calories (Glycolytic capacity).

### 5.2 Football (Soccer)

**Profile:** High volume aerobic base (10-12km total distance) interspersed with high-intensity efforts.

**Energy Systems:** Primarily aerobic (oxidative), with crucial anaerobic alactic bursts.

**Conditioning Focus:** Maximal Aerobic Speed (MAS) and Tissue Tolerance.

**Recommended Test:** 2k Row or 3-Minute Wattbike Test to establish Aerobic Power. Use the Anaerobic Speed Reserve (ASR) concept: conditioning at speeds above MAS.

### 5.3 Handball

**Profile:** Court-based intermittent sport. Frequent stops, turns, jumps, and high-intensity bursts (<15m).

**Energy Systems:** High neuromuscular load and anaerobic turnover.

**Conditioning Focus:** RSA and Change of Direction Economy.

**Recommended Test:** SkiErg 30-second sprint or Air Bike Tabata protocols. These spare the lower limb joints from impact while taxing the relevant metabolic pathways.

### 5.4 HYROX

**Profile:** "Threshold Endurance." The event lasts 60-90 minutes, requiring sustained work at or slightly above Lactate Threshold / Critical Power.

**Energy Systems:** Oxidative dominance with significant muscular endurance demands (compromised running).

**Conditioning Focus:** Lactate Clearance and Fatigue Resistance.

**Recommended Test:** 1000m SkiErg and 1000m Row Time Trials. These simulate the specific race blocks.

### 5.5 CrossFit

**Profile:** Mixed modal, variable domains. Requires high capacity across all three energy systems (Phosphagen, Glycolytic, Oxidative).

**Conditioning Focus:** Work Capacity (Area under the power-duration curve).

**Recommended Test:** 10-Minute Assault Bike Max Calories (Aerobic Power/Threshold) and 1-Minute Max Calories (Glycolytic Power).

---

## 6. Evidence-Based Interval Protocols by Ergometer

Based on the testing outcomes, specific interval protocols can be prescribed to target physiological adaptations.

### 6.1 VO2max Development (The "Long" Interval)

**Target:** Increase stroke volume and mitochondrial density.

**Protocol:** 4 x 4 minutes at 90-95% HRmax (or ~110-120% CP).

**Rest:** 3 minutes active recovery (Zone 1).

**Machine:** Rower or Wattbike. These modalities allow for the sustained, high-tension output required to reach VO2max without the localized failure often seen on the Air Bike.

### 6.2 The Rønnestad Protocol (Short VO2max)

**Target:** Spending maximal time >90% VO2max.

**Protocol:** 3 sets of [13 x (30s ON / 15s OFF)].

**Intensity:** ON @ 110-120% CP; OFF @ 50% CP.

**Machine:** Wattbike (Erg Mode is ideal) or Rower. This protocol has been shown to elicit a higher VO2 response/time spent at VO2max compared to long intervals in cyclists.

### 6.3 Lactate Threshold / Sweet Spot

**Target:** Increase the fractional utilization of VO2max (pushing the threshold "right").

**Protocol:** 3 x 10 minutes or 2 x 20 minutes at 90-100% FTP (or 88-93% CP).

**Rest:** 2-5 minutes.

**Machine:** Rower, SkiErg, or Wattbike.

### 6.4 Repeated Sprint Ability (RSA) / Sprint Interval Training (SIT)

**Target:** Improve ionic buffering and PCr regeneration.

**Protocol:** 10 x 6 seconds Max Effort / 24 seconds passive rest (1:4 ratio) OR 5 x 30 seconds / 4 minutes rest (SIT).

**Machine:** Wattbike (high resistance) or Assault Bike. The Assault Bike is particularly effective here due to the exponential resistance matching the athlete's fading power output.

---

## 7. Zone Calculation Methods

In the absence of direct lactate sampling, zones must be calculated via proxies (Power or Heart Rate).

| Zone | Name | % of FTP (20m Test × 0.95) | % of MAP (Ramp Test Peak) | HR Reserve Proxy |
|------|------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| 1 | Recovery | < 55% | < 45% | < 60% |
| 2 | Endurance | 56 - 75% | 45 - 60% | 60 - 70% |
| 3 | Tempo | 76 - 90% | 60 - 75% | 70 - 80% |
| 4 | Threshold | 91 - 105% | 75 - 85% | 80 - 90% |
| 5 | VO2max | 106 - 120% | 85 - 100% | > 90% |
| 6 | Anaerobic | > 120% | > 100% | N/A |

### 7.1 Adjustments for Modality

**Heart Rate Lag:** HR zones derived from running are often 5-10 beats too high for cycling/rowing. Expect lower maximal heart rates on ergometers due to differences in venous return and muscle pump mechanics compared to running. Adjust zones downwards by ~5-10 bpm for cycling/rowing.

**Wattage Anchors:** For rowing/skiing, use the Average Watts from a 2k Test as the "100%" anchor for VO2max intervals (Zone 5), and ~75-80% of 2k Watts for Threshold (Zone 4).

---

## 8. Test-Retest Reliability

To determine if a change in performance is a "real" physiological adaptation or simply day-to-day variation, the Coefficient of Variation (CV) must be understood.

| Test | CV | Meaningful Change Threshold |
|------|----|-----------------------------|
| 30s Peak Power (Wattbike/Wingate) | ~2.0 - 4.9% | >5% is generally meaningful |
| 20-Minute Time Trial | ~2-3% | — |
| 4-Minute All-Out | ~3.0% | — |
| Air Bike Tests | Higher in novices | Familiarization trials essential |

**Note:** Reliability is lower in novice users due to the learning effect of using arms effectively. CV improves significantly in trained populations.

---

## Conclusion and Practical Recommendations

To implement a robust ergometer-based testing system for team sports and functional fitness, the following guidelines should be adopted:

1. **Standardize the Machine:** Do not interchange Assault Bike and Rogue Echo Bike scores. If mixed equipment is used, apply a conversion factor (Echo ≈ Assault × 0.8) to normalize data.

2. **Use Power (Watts) as the Primary Metric:** It is the only objective measure of work. Heart rate is a secondary physiological response subject to external variables (heat, caffeine, fatigue).

3. **Test for the Sport:**
   - For Hockey/Rugby, prioritize the 6-second Peak Power (Wattbike) and 30-second Sprint (Air Bike) to capture neuromuscular and glycolytic capabilities
   - For Football/Midfielders, prioritize the 3-Minute All-Out Test (Wattbike) or 2k Row to capture Critical Power/Aerobic Capacity
   - For Functional Fitness, prioritize 10-minute Calorie Tests (Air Bike) and 1k Ski/Row tests

4. **Calibrate:** Ensure Drag Factors (Concept2) are fixed and recorded for all testing sessions (e.g., 120 for Row, 90 for Ski) to ensure longitudinal validity.

5. **Profile the Athlete:** Use the Anaerobic Speed/Power Reserve concept. If an athlete has a high Peak Power but low Threshold (CP), their conditioning should target aerobic power intervals (Zone 5). If they have a high Threshold but low Peak Power, they require RSA/SIT training (Zone 6) to raise their ceiling.

This framework allows for the precise, data-driven prescription of off-feet conditioning, maximizing physiological adaptation while mitigating the mechanical stress associated with high-volume running or skating.
