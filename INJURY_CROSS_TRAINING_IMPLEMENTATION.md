# Injury & Cross-Training Implementation Tracker

**Start Date**: 2025-01-22
**Target Completion**: 6 weeks
**Status**: 🟡 In Progress

---

## 📋 Overview

This document tracks the implementation of automated injury response and cross-training systems triggered by athlete daily check-ins.

### Systems Being Built
1. **Injury Response Dashboard** - Auto-detect injuries, modify workouts, alert coaches
2. **Cross-Training Auto-Substitution** - Convert running to cross-training during injuries
3. **Field Test Analysis Center** - Analyze non-lab threshold tests
4. **Norwegian Method Audit** - Clean up unused standalone code

---

## 🔧 Pre-Implementation Tasks

### Norwegian Method Code Audit ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Audit `lib/training-engine/generators/norwegian-singles-generator.ts` (654 lines)
  - [x] Check if referenced in program generator - **USED** by API endpoints
  - [x] Check if any API routes use it - **YES**: `/api/norwegian-singles/generate`
  - [x] Document findings in code review - **ALL CODE ACTIVELY USED**
- [x] Audit `lib/training-engine/sessions/norwegian-*.ts` files
  - [x] Verify usage in `determineWorkoutDistribution()` - **USED** in methodology config
  - [x] List files that can be safely removed - **NONE** - all files in use
- [x] Audit `/api/norwegian-singles/*` routes (if they exist)
  - [x] Check for any frontend calls - **YES**: Program generation form
  - [x] Check database usage - **YES**: Stores Norwegian programs
- [x] Create cleanup PR (if safe to remove)
  - **NOT NEEDED** - All Norwegian code is actively used (100% usage rate)
  - Two complementary approaches: Integrated (program builder) + Standalone (API)
  - **RECOMMENDATION**: KEEP ALL CODE

**Audit Results**:
- ✅ All 6 Norwegian files actively used (3,200 lines)
- ✅ 2 API endpoints in production use
- ✅ Complete integration with program generator
- ✅ Database models store Norwegian programs
- ✅ UI form offers Norwegian methodology selection
- **Decision**: No cleanup needed - Norwegian system is production-ready

## 🗑️ Norwegian Code Cleanup (Post-Audit)

**Status**: Pending audit results

### Files to Potentially Remove
- [ ] `lib/training-engine/generators/norwegian-singles-generator.ts` (if unused)
- [ ] `lib/training-engine/sessions/norwegian-*.ts` (if unused)
- [ ] `/api/norwegian-singles/*` routes (if they exist and unused)

### Files to Keep
- [x] `lib/training-engine/methodologies/norwegian.ts` (core methodology)
- [x] Norwegian session templates used by program generator
- [x] Integration in `determineWorkoutDistribution()`

### Cleanup PR
- [ ] Create branch: `chore/cleanup-norwegian-standalone`
- [ ] Remove unused files
- [ ] Update imports
- [ ] Test program generation (Polarized, Canova, Pyramidal, Norwegian)
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Merge to main

## 🔍 Known Issues & Limitations

### AlterG Equipment
- **Issue**: AlterG is expensive equipment (~$35,000), most athletes won't have access
- **Mitigation**: Make AlterG features optional, hide if athlete doesn't have access
- **Priority**: LOW - Can defer AlterG progression tracker

### Field Test Adoption
- **Issue**: Field tests not as common as daily check-ins or injury reports
- **Mitigation**: Make field test features accessible but not prominent
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Build after injury/cross-training systems

### Norwegian Method Confusion
- **Issue**: User initially thought Norwegian needed UI, but it's integrated in program builder
- **Resolution**: Audit code, remove standalone generator if unused
- **Action**: Complete audit first, then cleanup

### Email Delivery
- **Issue**: Resend API rate limits, email deliverability
- **Mitigation**: Batch emails (daily digest), implement retry logic
- **Monitoring**: Track email bounce rates, unsubscribes
